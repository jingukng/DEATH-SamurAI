    <h2>Outline</h2>
    <p>
      The final round tournament is organized as a single-elimination
      knockout tournament with 16 participating teams, with an additional
      third-place playoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the tournament matches is a single game (two races on
      the same race course exchanging the start position).  When the
      game is a draw, an extra game with a different race course is
      played.  When the extra game is a draw again, the team seeded
      higher will proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tournament is conducted as shown in the bracket on the
      right.  The numbers in squares are the seeding ranks of the
      participating teams.

    <h2>Race Courses</h2>
    <p>
      Race courses used in the final round will be generated by
      <a href=https://github.com/takashi-chikayama/software-for-SamurAI-Coding-2018-19/tree/master/course_generator>
	the randomized course generator</a>,
      used in the preliminary round, except for possible bug fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Race courses used in the final round satisfy the following.
      <ul>
	<li>The course length is between 100 and 200, inclusive.</li>
	<li>The course width is between 5 and 20, inclusive.</li>
	<li>The vision limit is greater than or equal to 5.</li>
	<li>The initial remaining time is 200ms times the step limit plus 1000ms.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      Seeding is based on team ranks resulting from the preliminary
      round tournament.  When more than one teams is ranked the same,
      the seed order is decided by drawing lots.
